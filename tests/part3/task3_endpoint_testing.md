# üêû Task 3 - Authenticated and Public Endpoint Testing
**Intro**  
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing that was performed for Part 3, Task 3 of the HBnB project, along with testing outcomes. All tests were performed using cURL commands.

**Objective**  
The goal was to verify that all authenticated API endpoints were correctly secured with JWT authentication, and that public endpoints remained accessible without a JWT token.

**Part One - Tests for Authenticated Endpoints**   
This part ensures that only authorised users are able to create, update, or delete resources such as Places, Reviews, and User details.

**Part Two - Tests for Public Endpoints**  
This part ensures that public routes (such as retrieving a list of places, or retrieving info about a specific place) are accessible without JWT authentication.

**Outcome**  
All tests returned the expected HTTP status codes and responses, confirming that the authentication and authorisation logic has been implemented correctly.


## PART ONE - AUTHENTICATED ENDPOINT TESTING
## # 1. Test Place Creation (POST /api/v1/places/)
